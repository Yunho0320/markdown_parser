# Java Streams
This is about Java streams.

## 1. What is Java Streams
In Java, a Stream is a sequence of data that you can process in a declarative and functional style. It allows you to perform operations such as filtering, mapping, and reducing on a collection of data. Streams can be used with various data sources, including arrays, collections, and even I/O channels.
```java
public class HelloWorld {

    // Your program begins with a call to main().
    // Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
```

Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Bob-->>John: How about you John?
Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

        Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
